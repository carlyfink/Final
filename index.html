        <h1>Composting in NYC</h1>
        <p class="lead">The DSNY Organics Collection pilot program began in 2013 and currently serves about 200,000 households in all five boroughs. The city plans to expand the program by adding additional neighborhoods over the next few years.</p>
        <p class="search">Type in your address in the search below to see if your neighborhood is part of the pilot program. If it isn't, you can still compost in your community by dropping off food scraps at one of the Greenmarkets located throughout the city.</P>

      <h3>Why Compost?</h3>
      <p> Roughly 40% of food produced in the United States is wasted, equaling a value of nearly $165 billion of food that could otherwise be given to people, animals, or composted. Most organic waste goes straight to a landfill, where it produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. However, when composted, organic waste can become a useful resource. </p>
      <h3>Composting in NYC</h3>
      <p>New York City produces nearly 14 million tons of waste a year. Organic waste, which includes food scraps, yard waste, and food-soiled paper products, accounts for roughly a third of the waste stream. </p>
      <p>In 2013, New York City Council passed Local Law 77 that requires the Department of Sanitation to establish a voluntary residential organic waste collection program and a school collection program. The NYC Organics Collections Program currently provides curbside collection services to over 200,000 households and 700 schools in pilot neighborhoods. The program aims to divert waste from landfills and process them at regional industrial composting facilities.</p>
      <p>In addition to the city-wide Organics Collection Program, the NYC Compost Project operates at the home and community level and aims to provide compost education and expand a network of community compost sites. The program encourages families to compost at home and drop off scraps at designated "food scrap drop-off sites" that are managed by NYCCP and GrowNYC, these mainly include greenmarkets, libraries, locations near public transit, and other high-traffic areas. Finished compost from these sites is donated back to greening projects around the city.</p>
